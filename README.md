ThunderRPC is a portable software made in Python using PyPresence Lib. that allow you to send RichPresence using a `Client ID`.
To make it work you'll need to fill all the field!, if a field is not filled, it won't work (maybe a error popup for later, I'll see!).

Have an amazing day, and have fun!

### üìë Python Libraries

ThunderRPC use <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pypresence/">PyPresence</a> to make the RPC work and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/customtkinter/0.3/">CTk</a> to make the app window.
From v1.3, ThunderRPC also use [pystray](https://pypi.org/project/pystray/) to make a system tray icon and minimize window instead of closing it!

### üîé Frequantly asked question

- My custom rpc doesn't disappear when I closed the app ?

Sometimes it happen, to repair it, open your task manager (
CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) and search for `ThunderRPC Reworked vx.x`, right-click on it and choose `End Task`. It should repair your problem.
If not you may forgot to close it into your system tray icon.

- The RPC isn't showing on my Discord profile, why ?

It may be multiple reason but here's the 2 most popular:

1. You Client ID isn't correct. To rectify that, go to your discord app on the developer portal and copy the `Application ID`, (NOT THE BOT TOKEN!), then paste it into the `Client ID` field and make sure all the other field are filled!

2. You send too much request to the Discord API, to rectify this, just create a new application and use this one instead!

### üèì Icons

From the v2.0 update, ThunderRPC started using [Google Fonts' Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Icons)!
