ThunderRPC is a portable software made in Python using PyPresence Lib. that allow you to send RichPresence using a `Client ID`.
To make it work you'll need to fill all the field!, if a field is not filled, it won't work (maybe a error popup for later, I'll see!).

Have an amasing day, and have fun!

### üîé Frequantly asked question

- My custom rpc doesn't disappear when I closed the app ?

Sometimes it happen, to repair it, open your task manager (
CTRL+SHIFT+ESC) and search for `ThunderRPC Reworked vx.x`, right-click on it and choose `End Task`. It should repair your problem.

- The RPC isn't showing on my Discord profile, why ?

It may be multiple reason but here's the 2 most popular:

1. You Client ID isn't correct. To rectify that, go to your discord app on the developer portal and copy the `Application ID`, (NOT THE BOT TOKEN!), then paste it into the `Client ID` field and make sure all the other field are filled!

2. You send too much request to the Discord API, to rectify this, just create a new application and use this one instead!
